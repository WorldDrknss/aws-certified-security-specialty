# IAM Groups
**...Containers for IAM Users**

* Exam Hint: Cannot log into a group, no credentials
* Collection of Policies
* No limit on amount of users that can be in the group.
* No nesting of groups
* 300 Groups per account
  * Can be increased by submitting a support ticket.

**Groups are `not` a `true identity`. They can't be references as a `principle` in a policy.**
